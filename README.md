# Apples to Apples – Interactive Company Explorer

This project is an interactive tool based on the "Get Better Measurement" report, which introduces a consistent framework for evaluating companies in the B2B creator economy.

Presented by East Wind Advisors, Creator Vision, and Creator Playground, the original report helps brands, agencies, and investors make more informed comparisons of platforms based on what they actually offer — from creator discovery to campaign reporting and predictive insights.

## What This Tool Does

This web app brings the PDF report to life as an interactive table. Instead of scrolling through static charts, you can now:

- **Search** for companies by name, category, or capabilities
- **Filter** by features like discovery, measurement, and proprietary data
- **Learn** what each feature means via pop-up explanations
- **Explore** companies offering specific functions or unique value

Our goal is to make it easier to compare platforms “apples to apples” and keep this list growing as the industry evolves.

## Who It’s For

- **Brands** looking to choose the right partners
- **Agencies** evaluating the ecosystem
- **Investors** assessing business models and differentiation
- **Anyone** trying to understand the B2B creator economy landscape
